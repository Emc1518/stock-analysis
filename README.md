# **Stock-Analysis**

  After providing Steve with a workbook to analyze stocks his parents were interested in investing in, he now would like to explore a wider range of stocks for his parents to invest in. 

## **Overview**

  The purpose of conducting this analysis is to determine how Excel's Visual Basic Application can be used more efficiently to analyze multiple sets of data.

## **Summary**

  The most important advantage of being able to refactor code is that it allows you to run the code in less time so it is much more efficient. However, I would say that a disadvatage of refactoring code is making errors while trying to find inefficiencies. If a code was already working and you made changes to it that did not work, now you have ruined the original code. 

  Refactoring the original was challenging because it seemed to be working just fine and then trying to trim off fractions of seconds from the run time was hard to do. I found that I had to have a better handle on the rules and concepts in VBA before I could even begin to refactor the original code.
