##**Summary**
  Advantages/disadvantagages of refactoring code?
  The most important adavantage of being able to refactor code is that it allows you to run the code in less time so it is much more efficient. However, I would say that a disadvatage of refactoring code is making errors while trying to find inefficiencies. If a code was already working and you made changes to it that did not work, now you have ruined the original code. 
  How do pros cons apply to original Vba scrpit?
  Refactoring the original was challenging because it seemed to be working just fine and then trying to trim off fractions of seconds from the run time was hard to do. I found that I had to have a better handle on the rules and concepts in VBA before I could even begin to refactor the original code.
